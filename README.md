# Mini-Game-Manager

Mini Game Manager for games that don't come on your favorite platforms such as steam or origin. The focus of this app is to create a game manager that works on Windows and enables users to import games from itch.io or Patreon and manage them from one software.

# Compiling it yourself
There are still a lot of known issues while working with Flutter version 2.10.3. You can download the repo and initialize it using Flutter and attempt running it using the Windows 10/11 SDKs provided by Visual Studio (not VS Code). But I haven't attempted to run or had anyone to run it on another PC. Knowing how many issues I had it is still buggy. If you can't solve the issue let me know and I may be able to help.

# Whats new
A quick break down of the versions, and what they implement:

## Version 1.1.0
- Adds tags, and search options
- Breaks down single game view
- Changes some behavior and features

**Known Issues**

- The changes don't apply after saving
- Changes don't apply live on single game view
- Some overflow in grid view

## To-dos:

- Add more view types, such as list view, and category
- A better game adding view, instead of picking files one by one
- Save file linking for quickly opening the saves folder of a game
- Multiple runners for games which have either tools, a launcher option, or contain x32 and x64 versions
- Steam integration (much later down the line)
- Itch.io integration (much later down the line)
